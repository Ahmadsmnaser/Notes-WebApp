# 📝 Notes-WebApp — Full-Stack Notes Application

## 🚀 Overview  
Notes-WebApp is a full-stack application for creating, editing and managing notes with user authentication.  
The app demonstrates product-oriented development including backend APIs, database integration, user interface, and secure authentication flows.

## 🎯 Features  
- ✅ User registration and login (JWT based)  
- ✅ Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) notes  
- ✅ Rich-text editing for notes  
- ✅ Responsive frontend UI built with React/Vite (TypeScript)  
- ✅ Backend APIs built with Node.js/Express and MongoDB  
- ✅ Data validation and error handling  

## 🧠 Architecture  

- Browser UI (React) ↔ Frontend App ↔ REST API (Express) ↔ MongoDB  

- The application uses a multi-layer architecture:

- Front-end built in React + TypeScript

- Backend built in Node.js/Express, connecting to MongoDB

- JWT authentication for session security

- Environment variables for config, secure use

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

   - Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

   - Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind (if used)

   - Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB

   - Authentication: JWT, BCrypt (if used)

   - Tools: Git, Postman, VS Code, ESLint

   - Dev Practices: REST APIs, modular architecture, error handling, responsive UI
